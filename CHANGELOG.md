# Changelog

## v1.5.3 (2026-10-17)

### Docs: SKILL.md now carries the README's content

ClawHub renders SKILL.md, so it is the skill page. It lacked everything the
README gained: fork context, the feature-diff table, and the scripts tree.
Anyone landing on the listing saw no sign of the calendar, the trip API or the
fork at all.

- Added "What's Different Here" (feature diff vs the original) and "What's
  Included" (scripts tree, now listing `garmin_calendar.py`)
- Fork note with the upstream link and why the fork exists
- `author:` -> `EversonL, bolinches`; Version Info credits both, and links the
  fork repo
- Install metadata pins `garminconnect>=0.3.18`
- Troubleshooting names the trip-API floor instead of a bare upgrade line

## v1.5.2 (2026-10-17)

### Docs: drop Clawdbot-era setup text

The setup section still said "Clawdbot", pointed at `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
and `~/.clawdbot/skills/`, and described "two different setups" in Clawdbot terms.
That text renders as the skill page, so the listing read as an old clone. Now
OpenClaw throughout, with the current config path and workspace layout.

## v1.5.0 (2026-10-17)

### ✈️ Jet Lag Adviser trips: read AND write

**NEW: trips can now be created, replaced and deleted from the CLI.** Trips have
their own API ([`garminconnect`](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect)
>= 0.3.18), separate from the calendar, and it is writable.

- Added `trip-list` / `trip-add` / `trip-update` / `trip-delete` subcommands to
  `garmin_calendar.py`.
- Endpoints: `GET|POST|PUT /jetlag-service/jetlag/trip`, `DELETE
  /jetlag-service/jetlag/trip/{id}`, `GET /jetlag-service/jetlag/status/daily/{date}`.
- **Live-tested end to end** on a real account: create → read-back → replace →
  delete, each verified against `trip-list` and cleaned up afterwards.
- Flight fields (all six required, one entry per leg, so a connection is two):
  `originLocation`, `originTimezone`, `originTimestamp`, `destinationLocation`,
  `destinationTimezone`, `destinationTimestamp`. Garmin does not geocode; give
  free-text locations and the UTC offset for that date. Timestamps are local time
  with no offset.
- **Gotcha found live:** a timestamp without a fractional second
  (`...T15:45:00`) is rejected with `HTTP 500`. With `...T15:45:00.0` it
  succeeds. The script normalises this, so either form may be passed.
- A trip overlapping an existing one is refused: `HTTP 400 "A trip already
  exists for this date range"`.
- Trips are auto-deleted by Garmin once they end and the user has re-adjusted to
  home time. So `trip-list` holds only current/recent trips; older travel survives
  as `jetLagTrip` day markers in the calendar. Both sources are kept for that
  reason.
- `install.sh` now pins `garminconnect>=0.3.18` (0.3.18 also dropped `garth`).

## v1.4.0 (2026-10-17)

### 📅 Calendar: Trips, Races, Events

**NEW: read the Garmin Connect calendar via `scripts/garmin_calendar.py`.**

The Garmin calendar-service carries more than workouts. Trips and races added in
the Garmin app land there, and trips are `itemType="jetLagTrip"`, one item **per
calendar day** of the trip.

- Added `garmin_calendar.py` with subcommands:
  - `calendar` — every item in the window
  - `trips` — trip days, grouped into windows. **The only source for FUTURE trips**:
    `get_stats().isJetLagDay` reports only days that have already happened, so the
    calendar is what makes pre-trip advice possible. `--with-names` labels past
    days from `get_stats().jetLagTripName` (one call per past day; names are not
    published for future days).
  - `races` / `events` — races and booked events, **with title and URL**
  - `nap` — recorded naps
  - `summary` — counts by item type, plus future trip days
- Item types observed: `activity`, `jetLagTrip`, `nap`, `userTimeChanged`
  (timezone change — the flight-day tell), `weight`, `event`, `wellnessActivity`,
  `bloodpressure`.
- Endpoint: `GET /calendar-service/year/{year}/month/{month-1}` (0-indexed month)
  via `get_scheduled_workouts(year, month)`.
- Dedupes items that calendar-service re-yields across adjacent month boundaries
  (events near a month edge arrived two or more times before this).
- Month-level errors are reported in `errors` rather than aborting the window,
  because calendar-service has a history floor (nothing before ~2024-12).

**Usage examples:**
```bash
# Upcoming and past trips, grouped into windows
python3 scripts/garmin_calendar.py trips --months-back 14 --months-fwd 6

# Label past trip days with their Garmin trip name
python3 scripts/garmin_calendar.py trips --months-back 2 --with-names

# Races and events
python3 scripts/garmin_calendar.py races --months-back 24

# Quick overview
python3 scripts/garmin_calendar.py summary --months-back 14 --months-fwd 4
```

## v1.3.0 (2026-06-02)

### 🏃 Activity Detail & Splits - Per-Second and Per-Lap Data

**NEW: Query individual activity details with per-second time-series and per-lap splits!**

- Added `activity_splits` subcommand to `garmin_data.py` — get per-lap HR, speed, distance, power, cadence, elevation for any activity
- Added `activity_detail` subcommand to `garmin_data.py` — get per-second time-series data with all metrics (HR, speed, distance, elevation, power, cadence, GPS coordinates, and more)
  - `--metrics` flag to select specific metrics (e.g., `directHeartRate,directSpeed,sumDistance`)
  - `--sample-interval` flag to downsample output (e.g., `--sample-interval 30` for every 30 seconds)
- Added `activity_id` field to `activities` output — makes it easy to query specific activity details
- Updated SKILL.md with new command documentation and question examples
- 20+ available per-second metrics including: heart rate, speed, distance, elevation, power, cadence, GPS, grade-adjusted speed, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, stride length, vertical ratio, performance condition

**Usage examples:**
```bash
# Get lap splits for a run
python3 scripts/garmin_data.py activity_splits --activity-id 600107330

# Get per-second HR and speed (sampled every 30s)
python3 scripts/garmin_data.py activity_detail --activity-id 600107330 \
  --metrics directHeartRate,directSpeed,sumDistance --sample-interval 30

# Get all metrics at full resolution
python3 scripts/garmin_data.py activity_detail --activity-id 600107330
```

## v1.2.2 (2026-01-26)

### 🧹 Repository Cleanup & Focus

**Removed old MCP server files** - Now using dedicated MCP server repo for Claude Desktop users:
- Removed `CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md` (old MCP setup docs)
- Removed `mcp_server.py` (old Python MCP server - 750+ lines)
- Removed `requirements.txt` (old MCP dependencies)

**Updated documentation for clarity:**
- README.md now clearly identifies this as the Clawdbot skill
- Added prominent callout directing Claude Desktop users to the dedicated MCP server repo
- Simplified `references/mcp_setup.md` to redirect to https://github.com/eversonl/garmin-health-mcp-server
- Updated file tree to reflect current structure

**New dedicated MCP server** for Claude Desktop users:
- Purpose-built Node.js MCP server at https://github.com/eversonl/garmin-health-mcp-server
- Uses modern @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- Easy `npm install` + `npm run auth` setup
- Comprehensive installation guide and troubleshooting

**Both can coexist** - Shared authentication allows users to install both the Clawdbot skill and MCP server simultaneously.

**This repo is now focused exclusively on the Clawdbot skill** for automated health monitoring, scheduled reports, and proactive check-ins.

## v1.2.0 (2026-01-26)
